## Team workflow
- Branch naming convention: NSCCS-ticket number where the ticket number is listed in the issue headline.
- All branches created are created off of release_candidate. 
- All PRs are pointed to release_candidate
- No merging without code review by a peer
- Only Ren√© or other admin merges release_candidate to main
- Once merged, announcement is made so all devs can pull in changes and update locally
